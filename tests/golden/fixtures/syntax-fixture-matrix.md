# Syntax Fixture Matrix

These `syntax-*` fixtures intentionally focus on language surface coverage.

They are input-only and intentionally have no `.err` files. Failures are expected until syntax support is implemented.

Keyword transition note:
- `segment` is the preferred section-selection keyword.
- `bank` is covered in `syntax-bank-deprecated` as a deprecated compatibility alias.
